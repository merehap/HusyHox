- A script to configure HusyHox as the replacement for the coreutils already running a machine.

#0.2

- Quickcheck tests for each utility.

- Tests for each utility ensuring output matching the GNU core utilities as the reference implementation (not BusyBox).

- Updated benchmarks for each utility.

#0.3
