In order to build HusyHox, browse to the husyhox/src directory and run:

> ./build.sh

This will run ghc with failure on any warning.

In order to build an individual utility, you will need to specify its module name (in addition to its file name) along with common.hs which contains code shared between the utilities.

To build just the [echo](echo.hs) utility, for example, as a stand-alone binary, use the following while in the src/shell directory:

> ghc --make -O2 -main-is HusyHox.Shell.Echo ../common/*.hs echo.hs
